Imo, it is, in a sense, as in not caring.
Unless some conspiracy theroy is true, Ukraine is fighting a powerful aggressor alone. By alone I mean aside from some volunteers, it is mostly Ukrainian that bleed and die fending off Russia.

In a world where people travel for fun, how many has gone to Ukriane to fight the fight in which Ukriane unfortunately being the attacked due to its geographical location? (I'm convinced aggressors can always find reasons, however unreasonable they might be, to start aggressions.)

If there is unity among us human, is it appropriate to say it is the business of Ukraine and the others are helping like it is charity?

It is hard to say who are helping whom.

Any help should be appreciated and starlink is surely an enormous help. In terms of amount it is more than many people and organizations combined.

But it is the soldiers who are giving their all, putting their entire existences on the line.

Lastly, I found it reasonable enough for the Ukrainian to be furious when they are asked to back down and let referendums that won't make much sense to decide if they can get back their lands, when it is them suffering war crimes, their people dying and their home burning.

But life is not a fairytale I guess. I am not sure if I still believe there is any worthy cause. Sorry for the over-reply. Don't want to delete it after typing.


I forgot to mention Urkaine used to have (former Soviet) nuclear weapons. Asking Urkaine to compromise (unfairly) out of the fear of Russian nukes is kind of a mockery to Ukraine.
