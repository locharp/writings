How many things could I be ridiculed for this essay?  captian obvious. How did we come to this situation where dictatorship, corruption, power hungry, exploitation... became so common, almost a norm now? (Almost seems to be an extraneous word.) Perhaps we can first think about where the people commit all these come from. I guess, contradicting some belief,  or rather, some narrative that means to justisfy unchecked power by claiming we must allow, rely on and support those in power because common people are not capable of dealing with those matters such as governing, these people come from us, the common people.

Now this sucks. The problem actually rooted from the common people, ourselves.

"Social justice warriors are exactly the Pharisees of our age. They are totally rule driven, everyone who speaks differently is unworthy to breathe, everything is a moral argument in which they are fully and exclusively right, and it all stems from agreed upon misjustices of the past which they believe there is no yielding to. Their entire persona, their entire being is wrapped up in sanctimoniousness and their struggle for social perfection. Just like Adolf Hitler, just like Vladimir Lenin, just like Saul of Tarsus, just like Mao. That's all they are."
