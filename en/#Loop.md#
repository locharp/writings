How many things could I be ridiculed for this essay? Social justice warrior, captian obvious, conspiracy-monger, psycho, hypocrite,

How did we come to this situation where dictatorship, corruption, power hungry, exploitation... became so common, almost a norm now? (Almost seems to be an extraneous word.) Perhaps we can first think about where the people who commit all these come from. I guess, contradicting some belief,  or rather, some narrative that means to justisfy unchecked power by claiming we must allow, rely on and support those in power because common people are not capable of dealing with those matters such as governing, these people come from us, the common people.

Now this sucks. The problem actually rooted from the common people, ourselves.

I once discuessed about this with a social worker of sort. She said that's why education is important. Exactly my thought, but I wasn't excited at all. The education system was corrupting. Yes, education system. Corrupt. The education companies treat student as products. Filling students with ideas of obedience, positive thinking and not judging.

Don't seem to be bad things huh? Combining the circumatances. Those are actually:
Get adapted to a hierachical system, do not question (the higher tiers).
Endure and get accustomed to negative environments and be positive (productive) within them.
Turn a blind eye to what is obviously wrong. 

Oh and what could I say. Ain't these the essential skill of sophisticates?

Perhaps it is not very fair to blame it all on the eduxation companies. Looking at how we teach the teens and kids. We cite moral lessons to them as the rituals of teaching. And then we show them otherwise with our action. One obvious example is the fairytales. This really is a sad one, not that the others are not sad.

Who are the primary audience of fairytales?
Children I persume?

Why are we telling them to children?
Because they teach moral lessons with happy and ideal endings?

How we truly use fairy-tales?
"Life is not a fairytale.", "Wake up from your fairytale mentality."

So we know some things are good and ideal that we would tell stories about them to the children. But we actually disapprove the ideas. We define them as naivety or outstraight folly that should not be pursued. Great. And don't worry, this is not hypocrisy. Hypocrisy is when one tries to stick to these teachings but fails to be perfect. Wonderful. More wonder-ful than the fairytales.



Social Justice Warrior (SJW)
I have heard this term and I knew it was a pejorative, but I looped up just now and found some things with which people define SJW. I have to say I have rarely seen anyone, push their moral views onto others except during a standoff to prevent something from happening immediately. Quite the opposite, I think that those who are called SJW are the ones being attacked. Here is a [quote from quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-SJWs-think-they-have-a-moral-high-ground-over-everyone-else)

*Why do SJW's think they have a moral high ground over everyone else?*
"Social justice warriors are exactly the Pharisees of our age. They are totally rule driven, everyone who speaks differently is unworthy to breathe, everything is a moral argument in which they are fully and exclusively right, and it all stems from agreed upon misjustices of the past which they believe there is no yielding to. Their entire persona, their entire being is wrapped up in sanctimoniousness and their struggle for social perfection. Just like Adolf Hitler, just like Vladimir Lenin, just like Saul of Tarsus, just like Mao. That's all they are."

This is not a carefully picked quote. It is just the first post I came across when I searched "social justice warrior moral". Under the same post are numerous others stating similars, discribing SJW as extremists who aggreaaively shove virtues down the throat of others.

Perhaps I have not spent enough time on social platform? I have seen people who would take every chance to demean others, including those who retort, mostly in a ridiculous  way, so probably wasn't serious. If those are what SJW refers to, it would seem a fair use. But what happens seem to be people are generalizing the term and label anyone who avocates or even  talk about justice and moral with it. Like an auto win button, I press it by calling you a SJW, and I shouldn't be critized anymore. Because you are the villain now. I have the moral highground because I accused you for thinking that you have the moral highground. You are an extremist now so your condemnation is false, so I an free of guilt. And the focus should be switched from the original problem to your personality because it is what should be concerned.

What I have just wrote is of course absurd. But often it is what happens, not only online but also in real life.

Citing a trendy term, auto win, free of guilt. It surely feels good and easy. Who doesn't enjoy feeling good? It would be unreasonable to make it diffcult for the others by insisting there is still a problem, for example, the original problem.

I mean to be that unreasonable person now. Am I raising a false issue that doesn't exist or is just a rare case? Or is it so common that we are already used to it? We are comfortable with it because it is easier for us. We are comfortable because we have the chance to gang on the SJW. We are comfortable because most likely the moral problem doesn't really bother us, until it does.

Let's be honest. We enjoy trashing people, especially when there is no consequence. We despise SJW because most of them are nothing but keyboard warriors behind the screen. But we are tongue warriors behind the civil code which protects us from primitive consequences.

All is good. Why couldn't we just take it easy and have fun?

All is good until it became a habit and problems are left undiscussed, let alone tackled. Not to mention the side-effect of hurting the accused SJWs. Oh wait, sorry for confused, that's actually the main-effect we want. But wait, what the original problem is again?

It would be crazy to think that this phenomena is planned. But it surely comes in handy for those who want to keep everyone else buzy for fighting each other with the self-generated incentive of wicked satisfaction. For those who want questioners to be deal with.

Whether if it is planned or not doesn't really matter, just as whether someone ia a SJW or not doean't really matter. What matters is how we are twisted from dealing with problems to dealing with people. What matters is that this is just one of the numerous twists. What matters is we are too comfortable with all these.

This is gd heavy. I am all for little banters and mischieves that are friendliness based. But I am afraid we are getting too far from simply allowing ourselves a bit of fun. What needed to be discussed have to be discussed. What needed to be done have to be done. A problem is a problem because it matters. If we keep on ignoring what truly matters. We, at the end, might find ourselves no long matter.
